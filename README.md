## Projects

### Navigation
>[P1_Navigation](https://github.com/rrstal/drlnd/tree/master/dqn-agent-navigation)

For this project, we train an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large, square world using Deep Q-Network (DQN).

### Continuous Control 
>[P2_Continuous Control](https://github.com/rrstal/drlnd/tree/master/continuous-control)

For this project, we train a double-jointed arm agent to follow a target location using Deeo Distributed Policy
Gradient (DDPG).

### Collaboration and Competition
>[P3_Collaboration Competition](https://github.com/rrstal/drlnd/tree/master/multiagent-collaboration-competition)

For this project, we train multiple (a pair of) agents to play tennis using DDPG with shared replay buffer.
